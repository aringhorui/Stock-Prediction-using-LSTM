# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data. The Python script downloads historical stock price data using the yfinance library, preprocesses the data, and builds an LSTM model using the Keras library. The trained model is then used to make predictions on future stock prices.
